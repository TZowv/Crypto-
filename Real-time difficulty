Can you have a proof of work blockchain with a realtime difficulty adjustment? What are some of the advantages of this setup? Limitations?

Advantages:
Faster Consensus and Block Times - Stability in Block Time / Real-time difficulty adjustment allows the blockchain to maintain a more stable block time. If a sudden influx of hash power occurs, the difficulty will adjust dynamically, preventing blocks from being mined too quickly or too slowly.
reducing of confirmation delays - Leads to more predictable confirmation times for transactions. which is good for businesses and users by reducing overall wait times.
Immediate Response to Mining Power Changes - If a large mining pool joins or leaves the network, real-time adjustment ensures the network reacts instantly to maintain its intended block interval.
Traditional blockchains take time to adjust difficulty (Bitcoin 2016 block). If mining power fluctuates rapidly, this can lead to temporary instability in block times. With real-time adjustments, the network reacts immediately, keeping the hash rate more consistent.
Improved Adaptability for Small Chains - Small PoW networks often suffer from fluctuating hash rates, where miners may enter and leave based on profitability. Real-time difficulty adjustment helps smaller chains maintain their block time even with rapid fluctuations in mining power.

Potential Limitations or Disadvantages:
Mining Pool - With real-time difficulty adjustment, powerful miners or pools may still be able to game the system by briefly injecting high hash power, adjusting difficulty, and then withdrawing it. Smaller miners may be disadvantaged, leading to centralization.
Overcompensation Risk - If the network overcompensates when adjusting difficulty, large pools could dominate by briefly manipulating mining difficulty to their favor.
Risk of Oscillation: If difficulty adjusts too rapidly, it could cause oscillation or "whipsawing" behavior, where difficulty fluctuates wildly. This may lead to short periods of either extremely easy or extremely hard block mining, which could be exploited.
Adjustment Algorithm Vulnerabilities: The difficulty adjustment algorithm needs to be carefully designed to prevent manipulation or exploitation by miners. For example, miners could manipulate the system by temporarily adding or withdrawing hash power to "game" the difficulty level.

Potential use cases for real time difficulty adjustment:
Fast-Block Networks: Real-time difficulty adjustment could work well for networks aiming for extremely fast block times (e.g., seconds) while trying to maintain security and decentralization. For instance, a blockchain built for microtransactions or IoT devices could benefit from the quick and dynamic response to hash power changes.
Blockchains used by decentralized applications (especially those requiring fast consensus or frequent transactions) could use real-time adjustment to maintain a consistent flow of blocks and reduce confirmation delays. Also New blockchain projects or small cryptocurrencies that struggle with large mining power fluctuations could benefit from real-time difficulty adjustments to stabilize their networks and prevent stagnation or hyper-fast block production.
